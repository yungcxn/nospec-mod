# nospec-mod
Minecraft Forge Mod at Version 1.8.9 for CWBW.

## CWBW
**Bedwars-Clanwar** is a Minigame on the popular Minecraft-Server [GommeHD.net](gommehd.net).
It's a game where four players fight against four other players.
When you die, you'll respawn, until your bed gets destroyed. As your bed is destroyed, you can't respawn after you've died.
The last standing Team wins.
There are many tactics around this GameMode, such as throwing Ender-Pearls, dropping TNT to your bed or jumping down a MLG-Way.

## Mod-Features
The NoSpec Mod has plenty of features:

### The Detector
You get a Chat-Notification, if a Player is holding one of the following Items:
- Ender Pearl
- Iron Sword
- Iron Pickaxe
- Potion
- Spawn Eggs (Here as TNT-Sheep)
- Flint and Steel

### The MLG-Way Detector
You get a Chat-Notification, if the Player is above the height of 169 (MLG-Way).
(You can change the value)


### The Config
The command to open the config is:
```
/nospec
```
It opens a GUI, where you can toggle the modules off, which you don't want to detect and adjust your MLG-Way-Detector-Height.

### Future Changes
At the moment, the Mod is only available in German, because the server and it's community is German, but I'll translate it into English...
- [ ] Finished translation

And maybe add other features into the *"OTHER"* content-section...
- [ ] add more features
